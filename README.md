# Human-Nature-Installation
 Project files for Human Nature, an interactive audiovisual installation mapping signals between TouchDesigner, SuperCollider and T-Stick gestural controllers

## Setup

Consult the `README.md`'s in each subfolder to learn how to set up each program. Once running everything on the same network, the libmapper signals will appear in the interface of your choice and you can begin creating mappings.

If you want to load the mappings we made for this project (in the /mappings folder), be sure to either use the same T-Sticks we used or edit the JSON files to match the device you're using. For quick loading, saving and staging use the [mappersession](https://github.com/libmapper/mappersession) Python module.
